<div class="description">My name is Jason Nordin and I have two beautiful daughters whom I love very much. Noelle is my oldest, she is 14, and Layla is my youngest, she is 12.
<p>I have been in the military for 21 years, 8 years in the Army and 13 years in the Navy. My civilian career has progressed from facilities to asset/inventory managemt to project management; now I am reinventing myself to be a computer programmer.</p>
<p>I am very excited to be learning this <b>technology!</b> I have always been fascinated with technology and have quite an extensive knowledge base about technology.</p>
<p>I like front end web development, it's fun! However, my <i>passion</i> is in cybersecurity! My plan for getting into the cybersecurity field is to become proficient with programming (while constantly honing my skills) and pursue my cybersecurity certifications.</P>
